## Plot and Navigate a Virtual Maze

This is the capstone project for Machine Learning Nanodegree in Udacity. We built a planner system that guides the robot to find the shortest path in a give Maze without outside helps, our planner only knows the Maze's size and the sensor signals in each turn.

## Self-made dependcies:
* `visual.py`, this class is for visualization
* `map.py`, this class is for storing wall information.

## Self-made mazes:
* bad_maze01
* bad_maze02

two bad-mazes to demenstrate the corner corner cases that have not be restricted by the problem setting.

## How to run it? 

* using terminal command: `python tester.py mazefile` to run it
* using terminal command: `python showmaze.py mazefile` to see the maze plotting

## Settings
inside the robot.py
* set `ifdraw = True` if the visualizaiton is needed
* set `method_2 = True` to use the scond method that mentioned in the report
